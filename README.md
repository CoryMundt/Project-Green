# Project-Green
My first python project from the bottom up and was actually created last year (I had to move the repo).  A terminal application that builds a database for crypto assets using the Coinbase API. It also allows the user to create custom tables based on time period coin. Just a heads up, before trying to run the app, the Coinbase API and/or library is out of date, so it no longer works. I no longer have a Coinbase account either, so I cannot update it.
